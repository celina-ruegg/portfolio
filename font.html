            Technology accompanies us every day, yet its inner workings usually remain hidden. This subproject looks beneath the smooth surfaces of everyday devices. iPods, headphones, and charging cables were deconstructed, analyzed, and then reinterpreted using Adobe Illustrator. The result is a series of clear, precise illustrations that reveal technology as an aesthetic phenomenon. At the same time, students learn the basics of Adobe Illustrator: how to use shapes, colors, and tools. Design becomes a discovery of the beauty of mechanics – clear, precise, and surprisingly vivid.

            Building on this foundation, the second subproject examines how music can be translated typographically. Based on the piece “Impro Bzez,” a typographic composition was created that transforms rhythm and movement into lines and shapes. The material was deconstructed in Adobe Illustrator and reassembled into an experimental font. This font finds its expression on a record cover that makes sound visually tangible. It was later further developed and given a new, more powerful variation – like a second note in a typographic chord.
